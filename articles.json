The login information below will outline how to properly log into Blackboard.\n\n## Login:\n\nBlackboard can be accessed [here](http://bb9.waukesha.k12.wi.us/)\n\nBlackboard Support Site: [www.support.blackboard.com](http://www.support.blackboard.com/)\n\n## Student Login Information:\n\nStudents will use their Domain Login to log on to Blackboard.\n\n> Username:  First part of district email address (everything prior to the @ sign).\n\n> > >\n\n> > ** Example**\n> >  <u>Staff Member</u>: John Testaccount\n\n>            <u>Email Address</u>: [jtestacc000@waukesha.k12.wi.us](mailto:jtestacc000@waukesha.k12.wi.us)\n\n>            <u>Domain Username</u>:  jtestacc000\n> \n> Password:  Same as your Domain Login Password\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n## Parent/Guardian Login to Blackboard\n\n<span class=\"colour\" style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68);\">As soon as students have been enrolled into a Blackboard course by the teacher of that course, the student's parents/guardians are also automatically enrolled into that course. Parents are issued a Blackboard login. </span>\n\nProvided a parent/guardian has access to all of his/her children with a single Infinite Campus Portal login, the parent/guardian will also be able to observe all of his/her children in Blackboard. The process for switching which child the parent is observing in Blackboard is outlined [here](https://docs.google.com/a/waukesha.k12.wi.us/document/d/1YDDrBV1Aq3LX7JbcAwOqBt9YCncRJw1YnLFrDy14eVo/edit).\n\nIn the event that a parent/guardian cannot see all of his/her children, or in the event that a parent/guardian is not aware of his/her Infinite Campus Portal login information, they should contact the building secretary for the school the child attends.\n\n## Finding your Blackboard Parent/Guardian Login Information\n[!\\[\\]\\(http://help.waukesha.k12.wi.us/_/rsrc/1413843655021/technology-help/blackboard/IC%20BB%20Account%20Info.png?height=320&width=160\\)](http://help.waukesha.k12.wi.us/technology-help/blackboard/IC%20BB%20Account%20Info.png?attredirects=0)\n\n## <span class=\"colour\" style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68);\">To find your Blackboard Parent login username and password:</span>\n\n1\\.
