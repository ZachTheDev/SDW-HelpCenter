The login information below will outline how to properly log into Blackboard.\n\n## Login:\n\nBlackboard can be accessed [here](http://bb9.waukesha.k12.wi.us/)\n\nBlackboard Support Site: [www.support.blackboard.com](http://www.support.blackboard.com/)\n\n## Student Login Information:\n\nStudents will use their Domain Login to log on to Blackboard.\n\n> Username:  First part of district email address (everything prior to the @ sign).\n\n> > >\n\n> > ** Example**\n> >  <u>Staff Member</u>: John Testaccount\n\n>            <u>Email Address</u>: [jtestacc000@waukesha.k12.wi.us](mailto:jtestacc000@waukesha.k12.wi.us)\n\n>            <u>Domain Username</u>:  jtestacc000\n> \n> Password:  Same as your Domain Login Password\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n## Parent/Guardian Login to Blackboard\n\n<span class=\"colour\" style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68);\">As soon as students have been enrolled into a Blackboard course by the teacher of that course, the student's parents/guardians are also automatically enrolled into that course.
